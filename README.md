# Exploratory Data Analysis of Irish Weather 🌦️

### Project Overview:
This project entails an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historic weather data obtained from Met Eireann, Ireland’s primary meteorological service. The dataset contains a comprehensive record of weather measurements over a period, providing valuable insights into Irish weather patterns. 📊

### Objectives:
- Perform comprehensive data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the weather dataset. 🔍
- Identify missing values and discuss strategies for handling them effectively. 🕵️‍♂️
- Extract meaningful insights from the data through statistical analysis and visualization. 📈
- Conduct comparative analysis to explore differences or similarities in weather measurements across different weather stations. 🌍

### Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of weather measurements recorded over a period, including parameters such as temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and sunlight hours. Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a specific date and weather station location. 📅

### Key Tasks:
1. **Data Loading and Description:** Load the weather dataset into Python as a pandas DataFrame and describe its structure, including the temporal resolution and types of weather measurements reported. 💻
2. **Missing Values Analysis:** Investigate missing values in the dataset and discuss various strategies for handling them, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. ⚠️
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Compute numerical summaries (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc.) for each weather measurement and interpret the results to gain insights into weather patterns. 📊
4. **Data Visualization:** Create graphical summaries for each weather measurement to visually explore trends and patterns in the data, complementing the statistical analysis conducted. 📉
5. **Comparative Analysis:** Perform a comparative analysis of weather measurements at different weather stations, including numerical and graphical summaries, to understand variations in weather conditions across locations. 🌐

### Usage:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter notebook file `STAT40800_Midterm_Assignment.ipynb` to access the code and analysis.
- Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed to execute the code successfully.
- Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the code, generate visualizations, and interpret the results. 🚀
